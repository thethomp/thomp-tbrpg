-- Known Bugs --

-- Needed for beta testing of tutorial level --
* Polish description text.
	-  Make sure all descriptions make sense, even after the player picks up items/advances the story.
DONE * Add oxygen mask to lockbox, player must equip before jumping from plane.
DONE	- Add the capability to interact with items that are more than one word in title length.

NOT DOING Make the move command trigger a specific description depending on where the player is moving from.
	e.g. move north = You look down the aisle of seats.
		 move south = You reach the back of the plane.
DONE 	Change directional look descriptions based on whether an item is present or not.
	e.g. look north = A shiny key glimmers on the ground.
		 take key
		 look north = The ground is barren.

-- Tackling Next --
DONE ** Inventory System
DONE 	* Highlight items that can be examined or picked up in the 'look' text.
DONE	* Create key and door that can't be opened without the key to exemplify interactable objects.
DONE	* Implement stats. Strength, Intellect, to start.
DONE	* Create items to equip. Staff and a sword?
DONE	* Show equipped items when looking at inventory.
DONE	* Add shortened version of inventory - inv.
DONE	* Add unequip command. 

** Combat!!
	* Need to get the level requirements working
	* Come up with experience gain mechanic
DONE	* Each enemy will be worth X XP. When the enemy is defeated, player will have that XP added to their XP pool.
		* Decide on how much XP per level there will be. Should it grow linearly, exponentially, etc.
		* What happens when the player levels up?
		* Firm up the level requirements for ability learning.
			* How does the player learn new abilities? Skill points that they can use to get an ability of their choice?
	* Player has list of abilities kept in YAML file.
		* Each ability has a level requirement and a flag for if it's unlocked or not.
DONE	* Combat mode will allow the player to type in what ability they want to use (via the 'action' command).
DONE	* 'abilities' command will list the abilities that the player has unlocked and what they do.
DONE	* After an ability is triggered by player, roll is done, and enemy will (for the time being, randomly) choose an ability to attack with.
DONE	* Each enemy will be defined in a YAML config (enemies.yaml) with starting HP, MP, and ability list.
DONE	* Each ability will be defined in YAML, with level requirement, damage, unlock flag.
DONE * Create Ability.py class to hold ability specifics.
DONE		* Name
DONE		* Level Req
DONE		* Player unlocked flag
